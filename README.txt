This project is a little minecraft minigame where the goal is either to capture all the ennemies flags or killing all the ennemies,
the core gameplay is a defense/capture the flag where you and your team build a defense in a camp that only you is able to place, break and interact with blocs in it,
the only things ennemies can do in your camp is placing/destroying and igniting tnt.
All the ressources you will need has to be gathered by leaving your camp letting it defenseless against attacks.
Some rules on the vanilla game are here to balance the game but the gameplay is pretty vanilla with random generated ores

Rules:
No Shields
Only Overworld
Ender Pearls does highly more damages based on your remaining health
Arrows with bonus effects does no damages to any player hited
You drop 100% of your XP when you die
All Ores give you XP and it gradualy increase with the ore type and it's doubled if it's in deepslate
If you take damages you won't be able to regain health within a specific amount of seconds
All Fireworks you craft take your teamcolor as their color
Invisibility effect no longer have particles, but other effects have
If you smith an item to netherite, all enchantments will increase by 1 even if it's not vanilla-friendly

for now:
you need a world named "-LS-<mapname>" and modify the config.yml accordingly like:
setting the value of current_map to the string of mapname and configure your map with the indication in config.yml (camps positions, highest_ground etc...)
/reloadmap is currently not working
