This project is a little minecraft minigame where the goal is either capture all the ennemies flags or killing all the ennemies,
the core gameplay is a defense/capture the flage where you and your team build a defense in a camp that only you is able to place, break and interact with blocs in it,
the only things ennemies can do in your camp is placing/destroying and igniting tnt.
All the ressources you will need has to be gathered by leaving your camp letting it defenseless against attacks.
Some rules on the vanilla game are here to balance the game but the gameplay is pretty vanilla
